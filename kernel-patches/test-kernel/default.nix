# Custom NixOS kernel package built from the net-next combined-test-rfc
# branch (4 patches: flow_dissector docs + flow_hash_from_keys_small +
# sch_cake adoption + bpf_flow PPPoE).
#
# Builds linuxManualConfig with the .config pulled from hp5's running
# 7.0.1 kernel, reconciled to 7.1.0-rc4 via `make olddefconfig` (already
# done — see hp5-kernel.config in this directory).
#
# Usage from hp5's configuration.nix:
#
#   { pkgs, ... }:
#   let
#     customKernel = pkgs.callPackage /path/to/this/default.nix {};
#   in {
#     boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackagesFor customKernel;
#   }
#
# To build locally before pushing to hp5 (faster on a multi-core box):
#
#   nix-build kernel-patches/test-kernel/default.nix
#   nix-copy-closure --to ssh://root@hp5 ./result
#   # then update hp5 configuration.nix + nixos-rebuild boot
